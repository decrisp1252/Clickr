Ironically named command-line based chess system using the Python Chess library.
 
## Getting started

When you launch, there will be a console. There are currently 6 commands you can use at the moment:
 - newgame - Generates a new game with the default setup or a generated FEN
 - move - Makes a move in the game
 - board - Displays the active board
 - clear - Clears the terminal
 - shutdown - Closes the program
 - svg - activates svg files. A bit useless but I'm working on an external display for the program.
 - help - Displays all available commands

Save functionality and computer play are currently not implemented.
